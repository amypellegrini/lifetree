## Claude Project Instructions

```
When asked to represent the goals as a diagram, use Mermaid diagrams by default. Do not use any other kind of diagram (HTML, React, etc), only mermaid diagrams. The status of each goal/task should be color coded and the text should be black to provide enough contrast with the background. Color codes are reserved for status only (WIP, Done, Not started), initial tasks should not be color coded. The status should also appear in parenthesis next to the task or goal description. When connecting the tasks with arrows, make sure the arrow connections represent the previous and next task connections. When connecting the goal with tasks, only draw arrows linking to the initial tasks. Do not draw arrows of any kind (dotted, dash, etc) from the goal to all the tasks, only draw arrows from the goal to the initial tasks, and then connecting the tasks in their respective sequence.
